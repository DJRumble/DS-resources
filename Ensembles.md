# Ensembles

## Bagging 

- run a single model. Get an estimate. 
- Run many single models. Average the results.
- Train in parallel

## Boosting

- Use the results from one model to weight to the successive models.
- Boosting sections where the results are misclassified.
- Weighted towards the better predictive variables.
- train sequentially.

## Blending and stacking

- splitting up your training set and running it though a variety of different models. 
- Use a second tier of models to merge data sets / weight over various modelling methods. 

## An ensemble contains a number of different classifier.

- Use different classifiying algorithms
- Use different feature sets per model
- use different subsets of the training data
- Use different parameters for the models

Aggregate the results to pool the various strengths in various people
