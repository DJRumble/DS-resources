# Generative Adversarial Network Tutorial

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of machine learning systems introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. \[1\].

This project is a simple tutorial that contains an implementation of basic GAN model and demonstrates how adversarial networks can be used to generate training samples.
